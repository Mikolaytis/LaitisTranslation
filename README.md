# Laitis Translation

You can help in the development of the Laitis project:
* Translating it into other languages
* Correcting errors and formulations in current translations

Rules:
* Translate only the text between the characters `>` `<`, do not translate the text in quotation marks `" `, this is the internal program keys by which Laitis finds the line it needs.
* Do not touch the `& lt;`, `{0}` and similar text-codes

PS: Monitor commits of Mikolaytis Sergey for adding new lines into files, that needs translation.
